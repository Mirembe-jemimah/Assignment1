       <h1>My Favourite Food</h1>
      
        <p>In order to perform well in life, our body needs energy.<br>
             We get this energy from the food we eat. Without food, 
             there will be no life. In today’s world, there are so many dishes available worldwide. 
             Food comes in a wide variety all around the world. <br> In my favourite food essay,
             I will tell you about the food I like eating the most.
        <p>Beef steak is my favourite food <br>
            And these are some of the steps on how to prepare it;
            <ul>
                <li>To begin, pat the steak dry with paper towels.
                     (Any moisture on the exterior of the steak must first evaporate 
                     before the meat begins to brown.)</li>
                     <li>Season the steaks generously on both sides with salt and pepper; 
                         the seasoning will stick to the surface and help create a delicious crust.</li>
                         <li>Turn on your exhaust fan and heat a heavy pan over medium-high heat until it’s VERY hot.<br>
                             The best pans for pan-searing are stainless steel or
                              cast-iron since they can withstand high temperatures.</li>
                              <li>Add the oil to the pan. 
                                  You’ll know it’s hot enough when it begins to shimmer and move 
                                  fluidly around the pan.</li>
                                  <li>Carefully set the steak in the pan, releasing it away from you so the oil doesn’t splatter in your direction.<br>
                                     It should sizzle. (Use a pan that is large enough that
                                       it’s not such a tight fit or the pan will cool down and your food will steam instead of sear.)</li>
                                       <li>Leave it alone! Avoid the temptation to peek or fiddle or flip repeatedly. <br>
                                        The steaks need a few minutes undisturbed to develop a brown crust.<br>
                                            (Don’t worry about sticking; the steaks will release easily when they are ready to flip.)</li>
                                            <li>Flip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a deep-brown 
                                                color (usually about 3 minutes).</li>
                                                <li>Continue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the bottom side 
                                                    for rare or medium-rare.</li>
                                                    <li>During the last minute of cooking, add 1 tablespoon of
                                                         butter and a few sprigs of fresh thyme to the pan<br> with the steaks (this is optional but delicious).
                                                         <li>If you are serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot. <br>
                                                            If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and let rest,<br>
                                                             covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then slice thinly against the grain. <br>
                                                             (Resting allows the juices to redistribute
                                                              from the outside of the steaks; if you slice them too soon, <br>the juices will pour out of them.)</li>

                                                    </li>
            </ul>

        </p>
