    <h2>Breakfast</h2>
    <p id="food">Breakfast is a great way to start your day.<br>

        While some people prefer to skip breakfast, others need a source of energy to get going.<br>
        
        If you enjoy breakfast, choosing nutritious foods may provide long-lasting energy 
        and keep you full for hours. <br>These foods are typically high in fiber, protein, 
        healthy fats, and micronutrients.<br>
        
        While it’s best to avoid unhealthy options that are high in sugar, 
        refined carbs, and additives, it’s not always easy to know what to choose.<br>
         As such, the list below will help you build a healthy breakfast.</p>
